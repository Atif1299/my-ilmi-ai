      "english": "Malik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that his father said,\n\"Abdullah and Ubaydullah, the sons of Umar ibn al-Khattab went out\nwith the army to Iraq. On the way home, they passed by Abu Musa al-\nAshari who was the amir of Basra. He greeted them and made them\nwelcome, and told them that if there was anything he could do to help\nthem, he would do it. Then he said, 'There is some of the property of\nAllah which I want to send to the amir al-muminin, so I will lend it\nto you, and you can buy wares from Iraq and sell them in Madina. Then\ngive the principal to the amir al-muminin, and you keep the profit.'\nThey said that they would like to do it, and so he gave them the money\nand wrote to Umar ibn al-Khattab to take the money from them. When\nthey came to sell they made a profit, and when they paid the principal\nto Umar he asked, 'Did he lend everyone in the army the like of what\nhe lent you?' They said, 'No.' Umar ibn al-Khattab said, 'He made you\nthe loan, because you are the sons of the amir al-muminin, so pay the\nprincipal and the profit.' Abdullah was silent. Ubaydullah said, 'You\ndo not need to do this, amir al-muminin. Had the principal decreased\nor been destroyed, we would have guaranteed it.' Umar said, 'Pay it.'\nAbdullah was silent, and Ubaydullah repeated it. A man who was sitting\nwith Umar said, 'Amir al-muminin, better that you make it a qirad.\n'Umar said, 'I have made it qirad.' Umar then took the principal and\nhalf of the profit, and Abdullah and Ubaydullah, the sons of Umar ibn\nal-Khattab took half of the profit.\"",
